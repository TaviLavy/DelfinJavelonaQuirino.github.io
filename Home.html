        <h2>About Pokémon</h2>
        <p>Pokémon (Japanese: ポケットモンスター <i>Pocket Monsters</i>, ポケモン Pokémon for short), sometimes shortened to PKMN, 
            is an overarching media franchise owned by Nintendo, Creatures, Inc., and Game Freak. First appearing in 1996 
            with the release of its first entries on the Game Boy, the game series has since inspired an array of media, 
            including an anime, a card game, numerous manga, and various spin-off games. The series focuses on the creatures 
            known as Pokémon, as well as their inhabited world, full of legends, tales, and adventures. Several interpretations 
            of the world explore different themes and elements. Most commonly, Pokémon coexist with humans and can be caught, 
            trained, and used in battles and other activities. Trainers, along with their Pokémon, travel across diverse lands 
            aiming to make their dreams become reality, and the bond — love and trust — between Trainers and their Pokémon is often 
            cited as the key to success.</p>
